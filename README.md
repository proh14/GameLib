This repo contains a really simple library for developing 2D games!</br> 

### Previewüôà:
(Make a video of the demo and upload it)

### How to use‚¨áÔ∏è:
1. Clone this repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kableado/GameLib.git
cd GameLib
```
2. Run `cmake` inside this repo's main directory.
```shell
cmake ./
cmake --build ./
```

3. Link the libGamelib.a file with your project!


Now that you built the library using cmake, its time to Link it!
Either take a look at directory Example.Gamelib to figure out how to link with cmake OR copy the ```libGameLib.a``` file to your project, copy all the header files in this project's ```src/``` to ```/usr/local/include``` and link manually with gcc.

### Documentationüìñ:
This project's documantation is work-in progress but I'm trying to document the source code for now!

### Work in progress‚öíÔ∏è:
This is still a work in progress project!
